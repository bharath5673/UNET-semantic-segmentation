# UNET-semantic-segmentation
This repository contains code for implementation of the [**UNET architecture**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf) for *semantic segmentation*.

## Dataset
The dataset is from the [**TGS Salt identification challange on Kaggle.**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tgs-salt-identification-challenge/data)

**Description**

Several areas of Earth with large accumulations of oil and gas also have huge deposits of salt below the surface.

But unfortunately, knowing where large salt deposits are precisely is very difficult. Professional seismic imaging still requires expert human interpretation of salt bodies. This leads to very subjective, highly variable renderings. More alarmingly, it leads to potentially dangerous situations for oil and gas company drillers.

The data is a set of images chosen at various locations chosen at random in the subsurface.The goal is to segment regions that contain salt.
